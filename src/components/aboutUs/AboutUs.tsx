                <span className="bold-subtitle">We believe that a world full of plants is a better world.</span>
                <p>We want to become your favorite place for everything related to the world of plants: from different types of plants, designer pots and accessories, to advice and personalized care programs.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to help you find your perfect plant to transform your environments into stylish spaces, full of life and warmth ðŸ’š</p>
                <span className="bold-subtitle">The moment is now</span>
                <p>The impact of CO2 is real: this gas is the product of industrial activity and emissions from cars. The excess of CO2 increases the retention of heat in the atmosphere, increasing the levels of global warming.</p>
                <p>Together we can make a difference and help reduce CO2 levels in our cities, helping to avoid climate change that can destroy our planet. How can you contribute? Whether your home has just one plant or a jungle: more green will help in the fight to reduce the amounts of toxic gases.</p>
                <p>MONSTERA collaborates with the Eden Reforestation Project to plant 10,000 trees a year around the world. With every order delivered, we help make the world a greener place.</p>
